# JavaScript Arithmetic Operations
This repository provides examples of JavaScript arithmetic operations. Arithmetic operations in JavaScript allow you to perform calculations and manipulate numeric values.

# Addition

javascript
Copy code
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a + b;
console.log(c); // 30
The + operator is used for addition. In this example, a and b are added together, and the result is stored in the variable c.

# Subtraction

javascript
Copy code
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a - b;
console.log(c); // -10
The - operator is used for subtraction. In this example, b is subtracted from a, and the result is stored in the variable c.

# Multiplication

javascript
Copy code
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a * b;
console.log(c); // 200
The * operator is used for multiplication. In this example, a is multiplied by b, and the result is stored in the variable c.

# Division

javascript
Copy code
var a = 15;
var b = 3;
var c = a / b;
console.log(c); // 5
The / operator is used for division. In this example, a is divided by b, and the result is stored in the variable c.

# Modulo

javascript
Copy code
var a = 10;
var b = 2;
var c = a % b;
console.log(c); // 0
The % operator is used for modulo operation, which calculates the remainder of the division. In this example, a is divided by b, and the remainder is stored in the variable c.
